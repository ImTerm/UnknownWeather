# Unknown Weather
A Lethal Company mod that disables the weather indicators on the terminal and monitor. This is to prevent players only navigating to moons without weather.

Highly recommended but not necessary to be used in conjunction with [WeatherMultipliers](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Blorb/WeatherMultipliers/) by Blorb for balancing purposes.
